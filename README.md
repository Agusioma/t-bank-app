# t-bank-app

This is a mini-banking app whose logic is based on [this](https://sacco.terrence-aluda.com/) website. It allows basic functionalities such as depositing, viewing statements, viewing balances, updating details etc. Currently, the deposit functionality is still being worked on. On completion, the app should have these features:

1. Deposit
2. Send money
3. Viewing transactions
4. Account details update
5. Password update

### Technologies used
