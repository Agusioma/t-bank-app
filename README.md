# t-bank-app
This is a mini-banking app whose logic is based on [this](https://sacco.terrence-aluda.com/) website. It allows basic functionalities such as depositing, viewing statements, viewing balances, updating details etc. Currently, the deposit functionality is still being worked on. On completion, the app should have these features:

1. Deposit
2. Send money
3. Viewing transactions
4. Account details update
5. Password update

### Technologies used
For the backend, PHP's Laravel and Java was used. The Laravel repository and its details is found in this [repository](https://github.com/Agusioma/t-bank-app).

For the UI, Android's XML styling was used.

It is still under development and it may have some bugs(not yet on Google Playstore).
